Understanding the complicated, intertwined relationship between Keras and 
TensorFlow is like listening to the love story of two high school sweethearts
who start dating, break up, and eventually find their way together — it’s long, detailed, 
and at some points even contradictory.
Instead of recalling the full love story for you, instead we’ll review the CliffsNotes:
Keras was originally created and developed by Google AI Developer/Researcher, Francois Chollet.
Francois committed and released the first version of Keras to his GitHub on March 27th, 2015.
Initially, Francois developed Keras to facilitate his own research and experiments.
However, with the explosion of deep learning popularity, many developers, programmers, and machine learning practitioners flocked to Keras due to its easy-to-use API.
Back then, there weren’t too many deep learning libraries available — the popular ones included Torch, Theano, and Caffe.
